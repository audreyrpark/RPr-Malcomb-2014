# Planned revisions to reproduction of  "Malcomb et al: Vulnerability modeling for sub-Saharan Africa"
Author: Audrey Park

## Analysis
In my reproduction, I plan to alter the climate vulnerability model to a multiplicative vulnerability score rather than an additive vulnerability score to allow for a minimum value of 0 and
a larger range of values in order to create a more comprehensive view of variation in vulnerability across Malawi. I plan to visualize results by creating maps to compare the additive versus
multiplicative scores.
